Decide on Inheritance or Delegation
Encapsulation and Indirection

How many ways to create object?
Objects are created only via Constructors (new calls constuctor). It depends on the different types of consturtor and super() method.


• Constructors in Java are inflexible
1. Can't return a subtype of the class they belong to
2. Always return a fresh new object, never re-use one
• Factories
– Factory method
– Factory object
– Prototype

• Sharing
– Singleton
– Interning
– Flyweight
– Dependency injection
